        <h1>El Parador Cafe, proving good food and a decent location is enough.</h1>
        <p>This is not a story about why El Parador is my favorite restaurant in “My New York,” though that will be talked about. Nor is it about the history or the people or the location, or anything like that as those are but minor bits in this story. This story is about my experience in the restaurant that is so impressive, and yet so normal, that hearing outlandish stories about who has been there only affirm how awesome this place is.</p>
        <p>Learning about the people who have been in this place feels like someone is setting you up for a joke. People like Woody Allen, Sting & Jackie-freaking-Kennedy, they don’t sound like the kind of people who fill the same space with everyday New Yorkers who eat at this place every day. Anthony Quinn ate here. I don’t even know who that is, which makes it all the more impressive, to me at least. It opened in 1959. Think about that. It’s the oldest Mexican restaurant in NYC. And it’s currently across the street from where I live, but that’s a separate issue. When it opened, under the ownership of Carlos Jacott, (No, not that Carlos Jacott) it took off “like a bat out of hell” (current owner’s words) & was an immediate success. Now under the ownership of the Alejandro family, it’s the longest restaurant to maintain a spot on my top-5 list, mostly because the others all closed. (We don’t talk about that.) Regardless, this place is amazing. Allow me to explain.</p>
        <p>When it moved to its current location in 1969, it succeeded in a crucial challenge, maintaining its customer base, mostly because it moved less than 5 blocks away. As a result, when it finished moving, it had an established foundation, and served many amazing dishes, (some of which it sadly no longer serves, like its lamb chops and some desserts) which were combined with the occasional menu expansion, adding things like my new favorite dish, the Pork Chop.* It made good food, and proved its worth to old and new clientele, like me, resulting in it being the place where I had a birthday celebration, and many good memories and get-togethers. </p>
        <p>In addition to just being well run, an important challenge in and of itself, it has cultivated an atmosphere of being fancy without actually being fancy. Everyone can have dinner here. People whose casual dress is a suit and tie, normal people, Mr Wells. Like that buffet that’s been memed to death, they serve everyone in this place.</p>
        <p>Which people really do recognize. While it doesn’t go out of its way to be romantic, the dimmed lights do give the proper atmosphere, which is probably why there are so many plaques commemorating people proposing in various booths. People like this place, which is probably why it’s survived years upon years. Once it makes it through this pandemic, it will have a truly impressive title. El Parador Cafe, Oldest Mexican Restaurant in NYC, survivor of a pandemic, beloved by many, and known by all in its vicinity. You wouldn’t notice it just driving through, but this place has people in it from the moment it opens to right before it shuts.</p>
        <p>In the end, El Parador Cafe represents “My New York,” because here is what I expect when I go to restaurants with long titles. And while places like Lombardi’s may be older, El Parador remains the benchmark to which I compare those places.</p>
